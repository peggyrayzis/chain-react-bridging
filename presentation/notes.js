  What’s up Chain React?! I am super excited to be kicking off day 2 with you all.
  <br/>
  Today, we’re going to talk about bridging in React Native.
  This is a pretty heavy topic so I hope you all have had your coffee this morning
  i know i’ve had a lot.

  intro2: `
  First I’d like to introduce myself, my name is Peggy Rayzis.
  I’m a software engineer at Major League Soccer on the UI team.
  I write a lot of React Native code for our greenfield React Native app & our realtime match experience on the web powered by universal components
  <br/>
  I also really love bridges, both of the React Native & real life variety. You'll see some cool bridges in my slides today!

  bridging: `
  Alright, now that we got all that out of the way, let’s start talking bridging.
  I’m going to use bridging as a verb a lot this morning - what I mean by that is how we communicate between JS code & native code in React Native.
  `,
  js: `
  How many of you would consider yourself mostly a JS developer? I consider myself one.
  I think anytime we start venturing into native code coming from a JS background, it kind of feels like this.
  This is actually a real bridge in Japan by the way. Absolutely terrifying.
  This bridge & the learning curve for bridging in React Native feels steep & insurmountable.
  `,
  js2: `
  Today, we’re going to make bridging feel more like this.
  Don’t get me wrong, it’s still pretty scary. You’re dealing with unfamiliar languages & concepts.
  But, once you learn a little bit about the mechanics and some tools to make it easier, you’ll start to see it from a new perspective.
  `,
  bridging2: `
  Luckily, you won’t have to reach for bridging too often.
  That’s why awesome tools like create react native app exist -- for most simple applications, you don’t need to write native code.
  Even for most complex applications, you won’t have to write native code too often.
  But it is useful to know how in case you have to.
  `,
  languageBreakdown: `
  Just to put it in perspective, here’s a language breakdown of our React Native prototype we built at the end of last year.
  This is for a greenfield app, so if you’re brownfield your stats might look a lot different.
  For us, the vast majority of our app was written in Javascript.
